Mapping Test Data to Ideal Functions using Interpolation and Random Forest Regression
Overview
This project involves mapping test data to ideal functions using interpolation and Random Forest regression. The analysis includes visualizations of residuals, deviation distributions, and cumulative deviation plots.

Features
Data Loading: Reads train and test data from CSV files.
Data Validation: Ensures the correct structure of the train and test datasets.
Interpolation: Aligns test x values with train x values using nearest interpolation.
Deviation Calculation: Computes deviations between test data and ideal functions.
Random Forest Regression: Implements Random Forest to predict y values and evaluates performance.
Visualizations:
